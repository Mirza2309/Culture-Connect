                <hr>
                <p>We plan on creating a platform for people from various cultures and traditions to share information
                    and tales which they observe remotely in their locality.We also intend to make people aware of the
                    real practices and customs to make them sure about each other’s traditions and avoid conflicts
                    happening due to lack of proper information.</p>

                <p>Upon receiving all the data, we aim to implement surveys and also provide a report based on AI on
                    various social aspects that often remain hidden from the entire community.Through this website, we
                    plan on successfully changing the stereotypical mindset of people when they see their peer
                    communities adapting a better lifestyle and positive psychological thinking.</p>

                    We tried to resolve the forgetfulness and negligence of people towards their own culture and
                    traditions.
                    The aim is to detangle lot of misunderstandings and lack of knowledge between people of various
                    cultures
                </p>

                <p>This distress often leads to never ending conflicts which are often insignificant in reality.
                    Due to this uncertainty in the accuracy or relevance of the information that is being spread</p>
